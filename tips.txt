Reference Books for GATE 2015 Preparation for Computer Science Engineering:
For CSE, most of the standard textbooks are really necessary for the basics and strengthening your concepts while the below mentioned books are some that can aid your preparation in a better manner with emphasis on each topic in detail such that the concepts are honed well.

Some Good Reference Books are:

Mathematical Logic, Set Theory & Algebra, Combinatorics
Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications by Kenneth H. Rosen
Discrete Mathematics by Seymour Lipschutz & Marc Lars Lipson
Algorithms:  Introduction to Algorithms by Rivest, Cormen, Stein, Leiserson
 
Operating System: "Operating System Principles" by Galvin.
 
Theory of Computation: "Theory of Computation" by Ullman.

Computer Networks:
"Computer Networking: A top-down approach" by Kurose-Ross
"Computer Networks" by Tanenbaum,
Computer Organisation:
"Computer Organisation" by Carl Hamacher - the syllabus covered in here is more in tune with the prescribed GATE syllabus
Computer Organization and Design -Patterson
Programming and Data Structures: The standard textbooks are good for C Programming while Introductions to Algorithms by Coremen is good for data structures.
 
Database Systems: "Database System Concepts" by Korth
 
Compiler Design: "Principles of Compiler Design" by Aho and Ullman.
 
Digital Logic: "Digital Logic and Design" by Morris Mano.
